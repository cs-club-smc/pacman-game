## Getting Started

Haiii ^w^, welcome to `smc-pacman`! To get the project running on your local development machine, follow these steps

### 1. Installing NodeJS

We are using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) as a backend server. NodeJS is a technology that lets us write JavaScript for backend code

The most popular way to install NodeJS is through the installer on the official website [here](https://nodejs.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

To check if NodeJS has been properly installed, you can open a terminal and see if you get the following output:

```sh
node --version
v17.1.0
```

Note that your version of NodeJS may be different than mine

Once you have done this, you'll want to install a package manager for NodeJS. Package managers allow us to easily use someone elses code in our project. The package manager that comes with NodeJS is called `npm`, but we'll be using `yarn` for this project. These days, there isn't a huge difference between the two, but Yarn is slightly faster, has a much nicer output, and does not print irrelevant errors / warnings.

```sh
npm --global install yarn
```

### 2. Cloning this repository
