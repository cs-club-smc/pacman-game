## Getting Started

Haiii ^w^, welcome to `smc-pacman`! To get the project running on your local development machine, follow these steps

### 1. Installing NodeJS

We are using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) as a backend server. NodeJS is a technology that lets us write JavaScript for backend code

The most popular way to install NodeJS is through the installer on the official website [here](https://nodejs.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

To check if NodeJS has been properly installed, you can open a terminal and see if you get the following output: 

```sh
node --version
v17.1.0
```

Note that your version of NodeJS may be different than mine

### 2.

Once you have NodeJS installed, you are ready to clone this repository
